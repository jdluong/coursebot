# Course Registration Bot

This bot can check for your course's availability or enroll for you. Or, perhaps its most powerful feature, check and *then enroll.*

## How to use correctly

***KNOW YOUR CODES AND SCHEDULE***

Use WebSOC and take note of the course codes that will work with your schedule.

- it's up to you to make sure the course codes are correct
- it's up to you to make sure the sections' times won't conflict with each other or your existing schedule

Half of the success depends on *you!*
