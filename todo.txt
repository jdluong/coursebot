TO DO:
1) refactor and integrate course.py
  - enroller
  - run.py
  - fix logic

WILL DO:
1) Make decorators for error handlers?
2) Page object design?
3) REDESIGN:
  - make 'add' and 'drop' objects so that:
    - you can perform them sequentially
    - decouple the enrollment actions
  - would look like:

    Add('12345',['12346','12347','12348'])
    Drop('23456',['23457','23458'])
    Add('34567',['34568','34569'])
